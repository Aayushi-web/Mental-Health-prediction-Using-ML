# Mental Health Prediction

This project aims to analyze mental health-related data to build predictive models that can help understand and predict mental health outcomes based on various factors.

## Objective

- **Prediction Model**: Build a predictive model to analyze mental health conditions based on available data, aiming to predict outcomes such as depression or anxiety.
- **Data Analysis**: Perform data exploration and cleaning, visualizing insights that can help understand trends and relationships in the data.
- **Machine Learning**: Implement machine learning algorithms to predict mental health conditions, improving accuracy over time through model tuning.

## Key Highlights

- **Data Exploration**: Process and visualize mental health data to extract meaningful insights.
- **Modeling**: Develop predictive models using machine learning techniques.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of various models and optimize them for better accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Other Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras (for deep learning models)

## Installation and Setup

To get started with this project locally, follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mental-health-prediction.git
cd mental-health-prediction
```


### 2. Install the Required Libraries
It's recommended to set up a virtual environment for managing dependencies. If you don't have virtualenv installed, you can install it using:

bash
Copy
pip install virtualenv
Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
# On Windows
virtualenv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Then, install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Notebook
Once the dependencies are installed, you can open the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy
jupyter notebook
Navigate to the notebook you want to run, and execute the cells to start the data analysis and model training.

### Model Evaluation
Accuracy: The predictive models are evaluated based on their accuracy in predicting mental health conditions.

### Feature Analysis: Various features (e.g., age, gender, lifestyle habits) are analyzed to understand their impact on mental health predictions.

### Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions, improvements, or bug fixes, please fork the repository and submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the existing coding style and include appropriate tests.
